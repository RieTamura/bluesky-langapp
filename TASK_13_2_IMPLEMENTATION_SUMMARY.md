  - Purple: Review-related metrics

- **Responsive Design**: All charts and components adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient re-rendering

### Goal System Features
- **Goal Types**:
  - Daily words: Track daily vocabulary learning
  - Weekly words: Weekly learning targets
  - Monthly words: Monthly mastery goals
  - Quiz streaks: Consecutive days of quiz participation
  - Accuracy rates: Target accuracy percentages

- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with percentage completion
- **Deadline Management**: Optional deadline setting with visual indicators
- **State Management**: Goals persist in localStorage with proper serialization
